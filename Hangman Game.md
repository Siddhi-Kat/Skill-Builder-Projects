# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

As I was learning **Python**, I built this **mini project â€“ Hangman Game** to practice core concepts like:

- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Lists and sets
- Input validation
- File handling (`JSON`)
- Basic game logic and ASCII art

This project helped me **apply Python knowledge** in a fun, interactive way while creating a complete playable game.

- Multiple **categories**: Fruits, Animals, Countries, Sports, Professions
- Three **difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **ASCII Hangman visuals** showing remaining attempts
