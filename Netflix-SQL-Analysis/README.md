## üé¨ Netflix Dataset SQL Analysis

This project is based on the Netflix dataset, where I practiced SQL by exploring and solving 15 business problems. It helped me strengthen my SQL query-writing skills and understand how data can be used to answer real-world business questions.

### üìå Project Overview

I analyzed the Netflix dataset and solved multiple case studies using SQL. The queries cover a wide range of scenarios such as content distribution, ratings, genres, actors, and trends over the years.

### ‚úÖ Key Learnings

- Writing aggregate queries to summarize data
- Using string functions (SPLIT_PART, STRING_TO_ARRAY) for text-based columns
- Applying windowing techniques and date functions for time-based analysis
- Handling missing data and categorizing content
- Translating business problems into SQL solutions

### üîç Business Problems Solved (with SQL)

1. Count number of Movies vs TV Shows  
2. Most common ratings for Movies and TV Shows  
3. Movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)  
4. Top 5 countries with the most content  
5. Longest Movie  
6. Content added in the last 5 years  
7. Shows/Movies by director *Rajiv Chilaka*  
8. TV Shows with more than 5 seasons  
9. Number of content items in each genre  
10. Top 5 years of highest content from India  
11. Movies that are Documentaries  
12. Content without a director  
13. Movies featuring *Salman Khan* in the last 10 years  
14. Top 10 actors in Indian content
