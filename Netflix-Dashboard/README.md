https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Standardized Date Added and Duration columns.
- Performed unpivoting to eliminate multi-valued attributes and convert the dataset into First Normal Form (1NF).

Data Modeling
- Built relationships between tables.
- Created separate relational tables for Cast, Directors, and Description using Show ID as a key for my single view titile page

Dashboard Design
- Designed interactive visuals: bar charts, maps, pie charts, and line charts.
- Enabled a detail page where selecting one title displays all related information (cast, director, description, and other attributes).
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight trends and patterns.
