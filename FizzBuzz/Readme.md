# 🎉 A Creative Twist on the Classic FizzBuzz

I recently attended a Python workshop(Pycon 2025) where we explored a fun twist on the classic FizzBuzz problem. Instead of the usual for loops or recursion, we tackled it using Python generators—and it was surprisingly clever!

At first, I wondered, “How can we do FizzBuzz without a loop?” But generators turned out to be the perfect solution.

- The code might look a bit longer, but the space complexity is constant—just one variable.
- We started with numbers 1 to 20, but with a small tweak, it can easily handle any range or divisibility check without a jungle of if-else statements.
- Here’s the quirky part: generators are a bit forgetful—once they move forward, they don’t remember past values.
  
Overall, this exercise was fun and eye-opening, showing me a creative way to solve a familiar problem with elegance and efficiency.

## 🌟 Key Takeaways
- Python generators can replace traditional loops in creative ways
- Efficient solutions can be achieved with minimal memory
- Small tweaks make your code flexible and reusable
- Exploring problems in new ways keeps programming exciting
